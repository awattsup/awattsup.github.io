My PhD thesis was completed at the University of Western Australia under the supervision of Associate Professor Barbara Catinella and Professors Luca Cortese and Chris Power.

I used some of the most sensitive observations of cold gas in nearby galaxies from the <a href="https://xgass.icrar.org/" target="_blank">xGASS</a> survey, cosmological numerical  simulations, and optical integral field spectroscopic observations to study how we can constrain the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies from _unresolved_ observations.

My results include a novel estimation of how obsevational noise impacts disturbance measurements in unresolved observations, a method for accounting for this to properly compare disturbance in galaxies, the connection between galaxy disturbances and their gas and environment properties, and insights into how these disturbances move across galaxies as a whole.
They have been published in four <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy)&q=%20%20author%3A%22%5EWatts%2C%20Adam%20B.%22%20author%3A%22Catinella%22%20author%3A%22Cortese%22%20author%3A%22Power%22year%3A2020-2023%20doctype%3Aarticle%20&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0" target="_blank">research papers</a>.
