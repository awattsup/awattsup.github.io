The first MAUVE OB got observed! <br>

<a href = "https://mauve.icrar.org/index.html">MAUVE</a> is a large program being undertaken with the the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. <br> The survey aims to answer key questions about the physical processes responsible for shutting down the formation of new stars in galaxies that fall into galaxy clusters. <br>

The image on the right shows a <em>very</em> preliminary three-colour image of our first observed galaxy IC 3392!
