MAUVE1:
  - excerpt: "The first MAUVE OB got observed! <br>
  MAUVE is a large program being undertaken with the the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. <br> The survey aims to answer key questions about the physical processes responsible for shutting down the formation of new stars in galaxies that fall into galaxy clusters. <br> You can read more about the survey [here](https://mauve.icrar.org/index.html).

### My research focus is understanding how the gas within galaxies is impacted by the evolution of galaxies themselves. 
{: style="text-align: center;"}

These gas reservoirs participate in a complex cycle of consumption to form new stars, replenishment from pristine gas inflows, and heavy element-enriched feedback from dying stars. However, galaxies are rarely able to recover a reservoir of star-forming gas once it it is gone.

_Understanding how, and why, galaxies lose their star-forming gas is essential to understanding galaxy evolution._

#### Current research
 I am currently working on several research projects, including:
  * How gas removal impacts the atomic and molecular gas of galaxies in clusters
  * The properties stellar feedback-driven outflows in galaxies and their impact on their atomic and molecular gas
  * Connecting disturbances between the different gas phases of galaxies
