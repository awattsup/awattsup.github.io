### My research focus is understanding the cycle of gas and star formation in galaxies, with the goal of understanding how galaxies die.
{: style="text-align: left;"}

The gas reservoirs of galaxies participate in a complex cycle of consumption to form new stars, replenishment from pristine gas inflows, and heavy element-enriched feedback from dying stars. However, galaxies are rarely able to recover a reservoir of star-forming gas once it it is gone.

_Understanding how, and why, galaxies lose their star-forming gas is essential to understanding galaxy evolution._

#### Current research
 I am currently working on several research projects, including:
  * How gas removal impacts the atomic and molecular gas of galaxies in clusters
  * The multiphase properties stellar feedback-driven outflows in galaxies and their impact on their atomic and molecular gas
  * Connecting disturbances between the different gas phases of galaxies
