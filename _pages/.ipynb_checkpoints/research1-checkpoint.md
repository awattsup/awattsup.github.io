  - title : A massive outflow from NGC 4383
    excerpt: The first paper from the MAUVE survey! We charactersied the kinematic and chemical propertiues of a massive ionised gas outflow from NGC 4383. Read more [here](/research-archive/2024-04-22-mauve_ngc4383/index.html).

  - title : Cold gas removal in Virgo galaxies
    excerpt: Using sub-kpc observations, we show that atomic and molecular gas that has survived ram pressure stripping is not unaffected, but instead both gas phases are systematiclly suppressed. Read more [here](/research-archive/2023-03-15-vertico_v/index.html).

### My research focus is understanding how the gas within galaxies is impacted by the evolution of galaxies themselves. 
{: style="text-align: left;"}

These gas reservoirs participate in a complex cycle of consumption to form new stars, replenishment from pristine gas inflows, and heavy element-enriched feedback from dying stars. However, galaxies are rarely able to recover a reservoir of star-forming gas once it it is gone.

_Understanding how, and why, galaxies lose their star-forming gas is essential to understanding galaxy evolution._

#### Current research
 I am currently working on several research projects, including:
  * How gas removal impacts the atomic and molecular gas of galaxies in clusters
  * The properties stellar feedback-driven outflows in galaxies and their impact on their atomic and molecular gas
  * Connecting disturbances between the different gas phases of galaxies
