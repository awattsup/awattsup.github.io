<p> My research focus is understanding how the star-forming gas in galaxies is impacted by the evolution of galaxies themselves. These gas reservoirs participate in a complex cycle of consumption to form new stars, and replenishment from pristine gas inflows and heavy element-enriched feedback from dying stars. However, galaxies are rarely able to recover a reservoir of star-forming gas once it it is gone. Understanding how, and why, galaxies lose their star-forming gas is essential to understanding galaxy evolution. </p>

 I am currently working on several research projects, including
 <ul>
   <li>How gas removal impacts the atomic and molecular gas of galaxies in clusters</li>
  <li>The properties and impact of stellar feedback-driven outflows in galaxies</li>
  <li>Connecting disturbances between the different baryonic constitutes of galaxies</li>
 </ul>

 PhD research

 <p> 
 My PhD thesis was completed at the University of Western Australia under the supervision of Associate Professors Barbara Catinella and Luca Cortese, and Professor Chris Power. 
 I used some of the most sensitive observations of cold gas in nearby galaxies from the <a href="https://xgass.icrar.org/" target="_blank">xGASS</a> survey, cosmological numerical  simulations, and optical integral field spectroscopic observations to study how we can constrain the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies from <i> unresolved </i> observations. 
 My results include a novel estimation of how obsevational noise impacts disturbance measurements in unresolved observations, a method for accounting for this to properly compare disturbance in galaxies, the connection between galaxy disturbances and their gas and environment properties, and insights into how these disturbances move across galaxies as a whole.
 They have been published in several <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_bibstem_facet_fq_bibstem_facet=AND&filter_bibstem_facet_fq_bibstem_facet=bibstem_facet%3A%22MNRAS%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_bibstem_facet%7D&fq_bibstem_facet=(bibstem_facet%3A%22MNRAS%22)&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy)&p_=0&q=%20%20author%3A%22%5EWatts%2C%20A.B.%22%20year%3A2020-2021&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc" target="_blank">research papers.</a>
